<h2>AI Search Engines</h2>



<p>Search engines are one of the most widely used tools on the internet, allowing users to find relevant information quickly and easily. However, traditional search engines have some limitations that can affect the user experience and satisfaction.</p>



<p>For example, they often require users to type keywords or phrases that may not match their natural language or intent, they may return too many or too few results that are not ranked by relevance or quality, and they may not provide enough context or explanation for the results.</p>



<p>To overcome these challenges, a new generation of search engines is emerging that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to provide a more conversational and personalized way of accessing information online. These AI-powered NLP chatbot search engines use natural language understanding (NLU) to analyze user queries and generate natural language responses that are tailored to the user’s needs and preferences.</p>



<p>They also use natural language generation (NLG) to create engaging and informative content that can answer user questions, provide summaries, recommendations, insights, comparisons, opinions, etc.</p>



<h2>Some examples of AI-powered NLP chatbot search engines are:</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h3>New Bing</h3>



<p>The new Bing is a search engine that uses the power of ChatGPT’s AI to create a brand-new search experience that can be quite powerful. Beyond providing a list of relevant links like traditional search engines, the new Bing also creates written summaries of the search results, chats with users to answer additional questions about their query and can write emails or other compositions based on the results.</p>



<p>The new Bing offers you reliable, up-to-date results – and complete answers to your questions. Of course, it also cites the sources. You can ask questions however you like and do complex searches. The new Bing also has a chat feature powered by a next-generation version of ChatGPT that can generate natural language responses based on web data.

You.com also has a community of users and industry professionals who provide feedback and contribute to making the search experience better for everyone.</p>



<h3>Perplexity AI</h3>



<p>Perplexity AI is a new AI chat tool that also has similar functions to a search engine. When a user inputs their question, the Perplexity AI’s model is built similarly to ChatGPT, and it utilizes its AI language model as well as relevant information from the internet to provide a corresponding answer.</p>



<p>You can ask almost all the questions you want and get answers in natural language with cited sources. Perplexity.ai is a cutting-edge AI technology that combines the powerful capabilities of GPT3 with a large language model. It offers a unique solution for search results by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.</p>



<h3>Neeva AI</h3>



<p>Neeva is a search engine that does not show any advertisements and does not collect or profit from user data. It also allows users to search for information on the web as well as personal files like emails and other documents.</p>

<li>They can improve user trust and loyalty by providing transparent and reliable sources</li>



<li>They can reduce user effort and time by providing direct answers instead of links</li>
</ul>



<h2>However, these AI-powered NLP chatbot search engines also face some challenges such as:</h2>



<ul>
<li>They need to ensure data privacy and security for users</li>



<li>They need to handle complex queries that may require multiple sources or steps</li>



<li>They need to maintain accuracy and quality of information across different domains</li>



<li>They need to deal with ethical issues such as bias, fairness, accountability, etc.</li>
</ul>



<h2>End…</h2>



<p>AI-powered NLP chatbot search engines are transforming the way users access information online by providing a more conversational and personalized way of searching. They have the potential to improve user experience and satisfaction by providing more relevant, engaging, informative content. However, they also need to address some technical and ethical challenges that may arise along the way.</p>

<h2>How to Export Products From The U.S.</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Export-20from-20USA.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Export-20from-20USA.jpg" alt="Export products from USA" title="Exports"/></a></figure></div>


<p>Exporting products from the United States can be a complex process that involves various regulations and requirements depending on the type of product and the destination country. Here are some general steps and tips that you may find helpful:</p>



<ul>
<li>First, you need to determine if your product is regulated by any federal agency such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). If so, you may need to obtain a license, permit, certification, or registration from that agency before exporting.</li>



<li>Second, you need to check if your product is subject to any export controls or sanctions imposed by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), or the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). These agencies may restrict or prohibit exports of certain goods or services to specific countries, entities, or individuals for national security or foreign policy reasons.</li>



<li>Third, you need to classify your product according to its Harmonized System (HS) code and Schedule B number. These are standardized codes that identify your product for customs purposes and help determine its tariff rate and eligibility for trade agreements. You can use online tools such as the Census Bureau’s Schedule B Search Engine or BIS’s Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) Database to find these codes.</li>



<li>Fourth, you need to find a reliable buyer and negotiate a sales contract that specifies the terms and conditions of your export transaction. You should also consider how you will ship your product, what payment method you will use, what insurance coverage you will need, and what documentation you will provide. You may want to consult with an experienced freight forwarder or customs broker who can assist you with these logistics.</li>



<li>Fifth, you need to prepare and submit all required export documents such as commercial invoices, packing lists, bills of lading, certificates of origin, export licenses or declarations, etc. You should also comply with any labeling or packaging requirements that apply to your product in both the U.S. and the destination country. You can use online resources such as Export.gov’s Document Library or Trade Information Center to access sample documents and guidance.</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Products with huge requirements from The U.S.</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2>Benefits of using freight forwarders</h2>



<p>Using a freight forwarder or customs broker can have many benefits for your export business. Some of them are:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Benefits.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Benefits.png" alt=""/></a></figure>

<p>They can leverage their expertise, experience, network, and resources to find the best shipping solutions for your products and destination countries. They can also advise you on the best practices, regulations, requirements, and risks involved in exporting.</p>

<p>By using a freight forwarder or customs broker, you can focus on your core business activities and leave the export logistics to them.</p>



<h2>Challenges and risks involved in this process</h2>



<p>Export logistics can involve various risks that can affect your export business negatively. Some of these risks are:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Risk.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Risk.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<ul>
<li>Credit risk: This is the risk of not getting paid by your buyer or getting paid late or fraudulently. You can avoid this risk by verifying the creditworthiness and reputation of your buyer, using secure payment methods, and getting credit insurance.</li>



<li>Cargo loss and damage: This is the risk of losing or damaging your goods during transportation due to accidents, theft, mishandling, weather, or other causes. You can avoid this risk by packing your goods properly, choosing reliable carriers and routes, tracking your shipments, and getting cargo insurance.</li>



<li>Transit risks: This is the risk of delays or disruptions in your shipments due to customs clearance, unforeseen tariffs, inspections, documentation errors, political instability, strikes, or other factors. You can avoid this risk by understanding the border control and distribution laws of your destination countries, preparing accurate and complete documents, and having contingency plans for alternative routes or modes of transportation.</li>



<li>Foreign exchange risks: This is the risk of losing money due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the time you agree on a price with your buyer and the time you receive payment. You can avoid this risk by using forward contracts, currency options, or other hedging instruments to lock in a favorable exchange rate at the time of contract signing.</li>



<li>Quality risks: This is the risk of delivering defective or substandard products to your buyer that do not meet their expectations or requirements. You can avoid this risk by ensuring quality control at every stage of production, testing, and packaging and by following international standards and certifications for your products.</li>



<li>Natural calamity risks: This is the risk of facing natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, storms, or pandemics that can disrupt your supply chain or affect your market demand. You can avoid this risk by diversifying your suppliers, customers, and markets and by having business continuity plans and emergency funds to cope with unexpected situations.</li>
</ul>



<p>By identifying and managing these risks in export logistics, you can reduce their impact on your export business.</p>



<h2>End…</h2>



<p>Export logistics can involve various risks that can affect your export business negatively. However, by doing some research and planning ahead, you can avoid or mitigate these risks and ensure a smooth and successful export process.</p>

<h2>Amazon’s Presence</h2>



<p>Amazon FBA stands for Fulfilment by Amazon, a service that allows sellers to store their products in Amazon’s warehouses and have them shipped to customers by Amazon.

<h2>Revenue from Amazon</h2>



<p>Amazon earns from its FBA service by charging sellers fees for storing, packing, and shipping their products. The amount of fees depends on various factors such as product category, size, weight, shipping distance, and storage duration.

<h2>Ezoic: The AI Ad Network:</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8XMTb2zCogn_SBIKtKPRcSBBG3sA3YZJAWAAr4t9xsnR0yQdlnX4B4cxY4f8IFnmT2ewSHGdg2-6-iYNFt9Mm2Qw8qvCYikxYNmvAonjuJoiLq8q7l9D1hWceW1TjYbD4brNpHfzYd-Whn8HctXR1fFA5AY247In27nqIKWqeO5lFipnmmSblvJ_9cg/s991/Ezoic%20-%20AI%20adnetwork.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8XMTb2zCogn_SBIKtKPRcSBBG3sA3YZJAWAAr4t9xsnR0yQdlnX4B4cxY4f8IFnmT2ewSHGdg2-6-iYNFt9Mm2Qw8qvCYikxYNmvAonjuJoiLq8q7l9D1hWceW1TjYbD4brNpHfzYd-Whn8HctXR1fFA5AY247In27nqIKWqeO5lFipnmmSblvJ_9cg/w320-h287/Ezoic%20-%20AI%20adnetwork.png" alt="Ezoic" title="AI Ad network"/></a></figure>



<p>Ezoic is an AI-based ad platform that works by using machine learning algorithms to optimize website layouts, content, and ad placements to increase user engagement and ad revenue. Here is a brief overview of how Ezoic ad network works:</p>



<ol>
<li>Integration: Website owners integrate Ezoic ad network into their websites by adding nameservers on domain name provider, cloudflare and with wordpress plugin. Ezoic then automatically starts testing different ad placements and layouts.</li>



<li>Testing: Ezoic uses machine learning algorithms to test different ad placements and layouts on a website to determine which combinations work best to increase user engagement and revenue.</li>



<li>Optimization: Based on the results of the testing, Ezoic optimizes the website’s layout and ad placements to achieve the best possible results.</li>



<li>Ad Serving: Ezoic serves ads from multiple ad networks, including Google AdSense, through its platform. The platform uses real-time bidding (RTB) to ensure that the highest-paying ads are served to the website’s visitors.</li>



<li>Data Analysis: Ezoic collects data on website visitors’ behavior and uses it to optimize ad placement and layout further. This information helps website owners understand how users interact with their website and what can be done to improve their experience.</li>



<li>Payment: Ezoic pays website owners a share of the revenue generated from ads served on their sites. The amount paid depends on factors such as the website’s traffic, user engagement, and ad revenue generated.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Revenue share &amp; Payments</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvwJrQVZcHXpOfZX8Js6RHHsrw2pSZGgagBB-6u8ofSJFnHkHrB93LUhAOtrihBdU0lIsMr35Vn25uWb2-MqKSnM-cPK0ON0v_9iOXtPzP3foJuZnaiWaEsbXaxR7GXZVgaSf_Y8Ag9KmBPMYHFLfQ3-4QYewYLTTeIFErBnkRuASirV9oeY85a0fkSg/s1566/Monetization.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvwJrQVZcHXpOfZX8Js6RHHsrw2pSZGgagBB-6u8ofSJFnHkHrB93LUhAOtrihBdU0lIsMr35Vn25uWb2-MqKSnM-cPK0ON0v_9iOXtPzP3foJuZnaiWaEsbXaxR7GXZVgaSf_Y8Ag9KmBPMYHFLfQ3-4QYewYLTTeIFErBnkRuASirV9oeY85a0fkSg/w320-h159/Monetization.png" alt="Ezoic Monetization" title="Ezoic revenue share"/></a></figure>



<p>Ezoic pays its publishers a share of the revenue generated from the ads displayed on their website. The percentage of revenue share varies depending on the publisher’s website traffic, user engagement, and ad revenue generated.</p>



<p>Ezoic uses a revenue share model, which means that a percentage of the revenue generated by the ads on the publisher’s website is paid to the publisher. Ezoic takes a percentage of the revenue as its fee for providing the ad platform and optimization services.</p>



<p>The revenue share percentage is calculated based on a variety of factors, including the publisher’s website traffic, ad revenue generated, user engagement metrics, and other factors. The exact formula used to calculate the revenue share is not disclosed by Ezoic, but it is designed to be fair and transparent to publishers.</p>



<p>Ezoic offers multiple payment options to its publishers, including PayPal, direct bank deposit, and wire transfer. Payments are typically made on a monthly basis, and the minimum payout threshold varies depending on the payment method chosen by the publisher.</p>



<p>Ezoic and Google AdSense are both ad networks that allow website owners to display ads on their websites and earn revenue from them. However, there are some differences between the two networks that may make one more suitable for a particular website or publisher than the other.</p>



<h2>Ezoic vs Google Adsense</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEl04G7flmg54TkL6pOIvCsybE9ln-eL8MBdMNHeHd2qEqzTvyMVWvRpZy9tYNO2flLJN0H4fJ3mKo92YvRStIuilh01_0556IjOtb76qmWVfpkQC3nd2HQ-4uyyDPm9Rc67RxUqzd0vvdcnfj-H8-9s42uTolryG3itqwWM7ISo9Rf7x0V39jixbmIA/s1510/Ezoic%20vs%20Adsense.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEl04G7flmg54TkL6pOIvCsybE9ln-eL8MBdMNHeHd2qEqzTvyMVWvRpZy9tYNO2flLJN0H4fJ3mKo92YvRStIuilh01_0556IjOtb76qmWVfpkQC3nd2HQ-4uyyDPm9Rc67RxUqzd0vvdcnfj-H8-9s42uTolryG3itqwWM7ISo9Rf7x0V39jixbmIA/s320/Ezoic%20vs%20Adsense.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Here are some factors to consider when comparing Ezoic and Google AdSense:</p>



<p>Ad optimization: Ezoic is known for its advanced AI-based optimization technology, which can automatically test and optimize ad placement and layout to increase user engagement and revenue. Google AdSense also offers some optimization features, but they may not be as advanced as Ezoic’s.</p>



<p>Revenue share: Ezoic offers a revenue share model that can be more favorable to publishers than Google AdSense. Ezoic’s revenue share percentage varies based on a variety of factors, but it can be higher than what is offered by Google AdSense.</p>



<p>Ad quality: Both networks strive to serve high-quality ads, but Ezoic offers some additional features to help screen and block low-quality ads.</p>



<p>Control: Ezoic provides publishers with more control over ad placement and layout than Google AdSense. This can be beneficial for publishers who want to customize their ad strategy or experiment with different ad formats.</p>



<p>Requirements: Google AdSense has more stringent requirements for website traffic and content quality than Ezoic. This can make it more challenging for some publishers to qualify for Google AdSense.</p>



<p>Integrating your website with the Ezoic ad platform is a straightforward process. Here are the basic steps to integrate your site with Ezoic:</p>



<p>Sign up: First, go to the Ezoic website and sign up for an account. You will need to provide some basic information about your website and create a new account.</p>



<p>Add your site: Once you have created your account, you will need to add your website to the Ezoic platform. To do this, click on the “Add Site” button and enter your website’s URL.</p>



<p>Install the Ezoic script: By adding nameservers on domain name provider, cloudflare integration or use Ezoic’s WordPress plugin to automate the process.</p>



<p>Wait for Ezoic to optimize your site: Once you have installed the Ezoic script, Ezoic will begin optimizing your website’s layout and ad placement automatically using its AI-based optimization technology. This process can take several days, depending on your website’s traffic and user engagement metrics.</p>



<p>Configure your ad settings: After Ezoic has optimized your website’s ad placement and layout, you can configure your ad settings using the Ezoic dashboard. You can choose which ad networks to use, set ad size and placement preferences, and configure other ad-related settings.</p>



<h2>Ezoic’s Affiliate Program</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVfilbyz9ME0CEYo3YXlDBdnM1Yc2UFWFPJnCI1FTRYMt4Am22eS2NvCVMtf8FnNnAXLaCKsM931_VG76CwRYSn21bqbtuRWz46ZYDTOjvpMT2vZTDg2lmzRv680SKHF3Ds0ZQwWXMcUrTUblSep2Z12yDECMsU8gfBpdpE5p7A4eYaF8RZwFdNybv0Q/s1330/Ezoic&#039;s%20Affiliate%20program.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVfilbyz9ME0CEYo3YXlDBdnM1Yc2UFWFPJnCI1FTRYMt4Am22eS2NvCVMtf8FnNnAXLaCKsM931_VG76CwRYSn21bqbtuRWz46ZYDTOjvpMT2vZTDg2lmzRv680SKHF3Ds0ZQwWXMcUrTUblSep2Z12yDECMsU8gfBpdpE5p7A4eYaF8RZwFdNybv0Q/s320/Ezoic's%20Affiliate%20program.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Ezoic has an affiliate program that allows publishers to earn commissions by referring new publishers to the Ezoic platform. Here’s how the program works:</p>



<p>Sign up: To join the Ezoic affiliate program, you’ll need to sign up for an account through their website. Once you’ve signed up, you’ll have access to your affiliate dashboard, where you can track your earnings and referrals.</p>



<p>Share your referral link: Once you’re signed up for the affiliate program, you’ll be provided with a unique referral link that you can share with other publishers. When a publisher signs up for Ezoic using your referral link and meets certain requirements, you’ll earn a commission.</p>



<p>Earn commissions: Ezoic pays commissions for both new publisher signups and ongoing revenue generated by those publishers. The exact commission rate varies depending on a number of factors, such as the referring publisher’s traffic and engagement metrics, but it typically ranges from 3% of the referred publisher’s revenue for lifetime.</p>



<p>Track your earnings: You can track your earnings and referrals through your affiliate dashboard. Ezoic pays out commissions on a monthly basis, and you’ll receive your payment via PayPal or wire transfer.</p>



<h2>End…</h2>



<p>To Conclude,&nbsp;whether Ezoic is better than Google AdSense depends on the specific needs and goals of a publisher or website. Ezoic may be a better fit for those who prioritize ad optimization, revenue share, and control, while Google AdSense may be a better fit for those who prioritize ad quality and brand reputation. Ezoic strives to provide a fair and transparent revenue share model and payment system to its publishers, with the goal of maximizing ad revenue and user engagement on their websites.</p>

<p>The platform could use data such as employee availability, skill sets, job roles, and past scheduling history to create optimized schedules with minimal conflicts and also automate the processes of shift swapping, time-off requests, and other schedule-related tasks. The&nbsp;<a href="https://cluefill.com/2023/02/24/how-to-create-a-chatbot-like-chatgpt/">AI</a>&nbsp;could also be trained to predict and prevent scheduling issues, such as understaffing, by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns.</p>



<h3>AI in Shopping</h3>



<p>The platform could be offered as a web or mobile app and could be marketed to a wide range of businesses, including retail stores, restaurants, hospitals, and manufacturing plants.</p>



<p>Another idea could be an AI-powered personal shopping assistant that helps consumers discover new products and make personalized product recommendations based on their browsing and purchasing history, demographics, and personal preferences. The AI-shopping assistant could be integrated into e-commerce websites and mobile apps and could be used to increase sales and customer retention.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhs_aKKJVnnzNMP0ESnzsYqZjuTe6fKJZflgEZkA-wnKnM4eEk3-kLgaDaTcmtaruGTk3EEHghv3of6Niv--y3g97Z3W8BCU8PNXObVoJwe9qNBanKX2Pgg_dMFFzShfLZzqQeXCpzO_qgevSK0CabWOCoLpDGEApdN0TvcPEQ3ZK7XvBZniR6u64dtRQ/s1129/ai%20shopping.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhs_aKKJVnnzNMP0ESnzsYqZjuTe6fKJZflgEZkA-wnKnM4eEk3-kLgaDaTcmtaruGTk3EEHghv3of6Niv--y3g97Z3W8BCU8PNXObVoJwe9qNBanKX2Pgg_dMFFzShfLZzqQeXCpzO_qgevSK0CabWOCoLpDGEApdN0TvcPEQ3ZK7XvBZniR6u64dtRQ/s320/ai%20shopping.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<h3>AI in Entertainment Industry</h3>



<p>In the entertainment industry could be a platform that uses machine learning to recommend personalized music playlists for users. The platform could analyze a user’s listening history, their favorite artists, and their mood to create custom playlists that cater to their individual tastes and preferences.</p>



<p>The AI could also be trained to recognise different music genres and automatically suggest new songs and artists that are similar to the user’s favourite music. Additionally, the platform could have an option for users to discover new music based on their location, the time of day, and their activities.</p>



<p>The platform could be integrated into music streaming services and could also be offered as a standalone app for both iOS and Android devices. The platform could be marketed to music lovers as well as music industry professionals who are looking for new and upcoming artists.</p>



<h3>AI in VR</h3>



<p>Another AI startup idea in the entertainment industry could be a virtual reality platform that uses machine learning to create personalised and interactive movie and TV show experiences for users. The platform would use data such as viewing history, preferences, demographics, and even biometric data (e.g., facial expressions, heart rate) to tailor the content to the users’ preferences and reactions.</p>



<p>For example, the platform could allow users to interact with characters and environments in a virtual world, make choices that affect the outcome of the story, or even have the story adapt to their emotions and reactions in real-time. It could also offer an immersive experience, where the users could be part of the story rather than just watching it.</p>

<p>The platform could be accessed through web and mobile apps, and could be offered as a subscription-based service to small business owners. The platform could be marketed to small business owners, entrepreneurs, and start-ups looking for an efficient and cost-effective way to manage their finances and accounting.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiB1TA0eObuR8r-hQjxHkswH4buRiCDnFT-53j0n8GbTQI6D5WmGyidoLRyxFCh37UCOSULXNDrX-kdnfy7NKxKN-nwH3hUd9ICvwNMy1-Yik1fAP-1s_lcuiJbv6C3oECQSk3mXEOafMGGEWXLO6_AoTGipr0eBiOQHtROuxD-bsElE5ARYK-so_pyKA/s705/chat%20gpt.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiB1TA0eObuR8r-hQjxHkswH4buRiCDnFT-53j0n8GbTQI6D5WmGyidoLRyxFCh37UCOSULXNDrX-kdnfy7NKxKN-nwH3hUd9ICvwNMy1-Yik1fAP-1s_lcuiJbv6C3oECQSk3mXEOafMGGEWXLO6_AoTGipr0eBiOQHtROuxD-bsElE5ARYK-so_pyKA/w320-h198/chat%20gpt.png" alt="Chatbot" title="Chat GPT"/></a></figure>



<p>Creating a chatbot like ChatGPT involves a complex process that requires a deep understanding of natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Here are the general steps you would need to follow to create a chatbot like ChatGPT</p>



<h3>Determine the purpose of your chatbot</h3>



<p>Decide what your chatbot will be used for and what kind of interactions it will have with users. This will help you determine the features and capabilities you need to include in your chatbot.</p>



<h3>Choose a platform</h3>



<p>There are many platforms available for building chatbots, such as Microsoft Bot Framework, Google Dialogflow, and IBM Watson. Choose a platform that suits your needs and experience level.</p>



<h3>Design your chatbot’s personality</h3>



<p>Decide on the personality and tone of your chatbot, which will help you determine the language it uses and the kinds of responses it gives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQ7gpKJeReeWWBJ0EFKbts8SbBh3B3r5pvtB1Vuv-hjaAYNrwSMGe66I1xgUCwATpfr3ZmvJBcSoUDZO-wGoGoC6q6lcqPGiSk3L7BTQF0facNCWS0XZp7nQT9fjSpwx4VJW0J4k6yM_dBEWoBV1myN4EVoP7lfDa6cVWCB85utSwrSRYeYJ0b9c3fcQ/s1200/chat%20bot%20like%20chat%20gpt.webp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQ7gpKJeReeWWBJ0EFKbts8SbBh3B3r5pvtB1Vuv-hjaAYNrwSMGe66I1xgUCwATpfr3ZmvJBcSoUDZO-wGoGoC6q6lcqPGiSk3L7BTQF0facNCWS0XZp7nQT9fjSpwx4VJW0J4k6yM_dBEWoBV1myN4EVoP7lfDa6cVWCB85utSwrSRYeYJ0b9c3fcQ/s320/chat%20bot%20like%20chat%20gpt.webp" alt=""/></a></figure>



<h3>Create a knowledge base</h3>



<p>Develop a knowledge base of <a href="https://cluefill.com/2023/03/01/5-amazing-ai-powered-search-engines/">information that your chatbot</a> can use to answer questions and respond to user input.</p>



<h3>Train your chatbot</h3>



<p>Use machine learning algorithms to train your chatbot on your knowledge base and teach it to respond appropriately to user input.</p>



<h3>Test and refine your chatbot</h3>



<p>Test your chatbot thoroughly to identify areas where it needs improvement, and refine its responses and capabilities over time.</p>



<h2>The Cost</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMYLoMqLEaFMH0eZ2vwDxkoBUYnQ0TBxUR-RHzAdm76xxHiGO4K9ynD2fnW1PIGdO9DDEteCKqTl0NN3LMXphkjeHYm7ICEsPjliIC6z5JxyPWBmHr_U-CUXY7mTyB7RtOcB4iW78k7YEZJdnZsBnLuz_sLWZvnLbWYtbnWHBpSY2e-avw4RrzxiFyIw/s1120/cost.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMYLoMqLEaFMH0eZ2vwDxkoBUYnQ0TBxUR-RHzAdm76xxHiGO4K9ynD2fnW1PIGdO9DDEteCKqTl0NN3LMXphkjeHYm7ICEsPjliIC6z5JxyPWBmHr_U-CUXY7mTyB7RtOcB4iW78k7YEZJdnZsBnLuz_sLWZvnLbWYtbnWHBpSY2e-avw4RrzxiFyIw/s320/cost.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>The cost of running a server for a chat bot like ChatGPT would depend on factors such as the size of the server cluster, the amount of storage and memory required, and the number of users interacting with the system.</p>



<p>If the number of users were to increase, the Chat bot would likely need to scale its server infrastructure to accommodate the increased traffic and usage. This could involve adding more servers or upgrading existing ones to handle the additional load.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjVv5mMTMKW2D6rK_l8Gz39G7WgEoZ9xSrnz5RtPqNOpkk4iCphP18NeC0wqPqVoK44CEqrZPIYWXMvCD1JKhzOB-22ZEyZEF1Hkjz3mUJl1swUHQzUSK2MexhNg95NbWRcz7M8uS_ETw8LDu9YtUOgBvVUFHtpiFBSw0pT_YAPIl5ed47QT1nVKlncAA/s612/servers.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjVv5mMTMKW2D6rK_l8Gz39G7WgEoZ9xSrnz5RtPqNOpkk4iCphP18NeC0wqPqVoK44CEqrZPIYWXMvCD1JKhzOB-22ZEyZEF1Hkjz3mUJl1swUHQzUSK2MexhNg95NbWRcz7M8uS_ETw8LDu9YtUOgBvVUFHtpiFBSw0pT_YAPIl5ed47QT1nVKlncAA/s320/servers.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>As for server requirements, these would depend on the specific implementation of the system and the tasks it is performing. Generally, AI language models like ChatGPT require significant computational resources to train and run, and may require specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs to operate efficiently. The specific server requirements would depend on the size and complexity of the model, as well as the amount of traffic it is handling.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that building a chatbot like ChatGPT requires a high level of technical expertise and specialized knowledge. It may be helpful to work with a team of experienced developers and data scientists to ensure that your chatbot is effective, efficient, and meets the needs of your users.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What Would Be The Future Technology?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hotpot.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hotpot.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>We are in the year the 2020s, and if we’re being honest with ourselves, technology is incredibly advanced, and we’re making strides that can push things even further. We have cars that are much safer than they’ve been in the past decade, and we’re even making fully electric cars that can help save the planet. There are even plans for self-driving cars and even self-driving Ubers that make the future of transportation very exciting. And that’s just ONE technology that we’re growing at a fast rate.</p>



<p><strong>What about all the others that are out there?</strong></p>



<p><strong>What will technology be like as we get closer and closer to 2050?</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Drones</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drones.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drones.png" alt="2050" title="Future"/></a></figure>



<p>Let’s start with the one that well and truly could happen very soon, drones. Drones are already here!” and yes, they are. But more times than not the drones you are seeing are small, piloted by people who are just trying to have some fun, or, are the ones that are used by the military right now for strikes and surveillance. All very fun, but in the future, drones could be an integral part of our daily lives.</p>



<p>In some shows, people talk about how in a few years drones could be the new delivery service. Anything from pizza to Amazon packages, and more. And honestly…that’s very probable. Drones right now can be incredibly sophisticated, and some TV shows use them for sweeping and aerial shots as the film, it’s very cool. But to do deliveries, that’d have to be a little more programmed, as human error no doubt would be a very big buzzkill.</p>



<p>Not that it’s impossible right now, it’s more of a question of numbers, logistics, costs, and making sure that the deliveries themselves are done methodically and carefully. After all, it’s bad enough when delivery people don’t care enough about our packages that they just throw them onto the porch and potentially break stuff, the last thing we need is that to happen with drones.</p>



<p><strong>But by 2050?</strong></p>



<h3><strong>The change in Transportation and Logistics</strong></h3>



<p>We might not only have drones delivering our packages, but we might also be looking up at the sky and seeing drones flying all over with incredible speeds and accuracy, and they potentially could all be run by AI! The potential is there, and by that point, various upgrades to drones and their programming will no doubt make them all the more efficient, durable, and quick. And potentially, they could go beyond basic deliveries for people and do emergency work.</p>



<p><strong>Imagine a drone taking a vital piece of medical material to a hospital to ensure it doesn’t get stuck in traffic.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Or helping watch over an important convoy to let people know on the ground if there is the trouble?</strong></p>



<p><strong>There are many ways that drones could affect our world, the only question is, will we let them by 2050?</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drone-20Logistics.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Drone-20Logistics.png" alt="Drone Logistics" title="Future of drone in 2050"/></a></figure>



<p>Right now, one of the biggest ways to get around the countries we live in is by train. Trains ferry people and all sorts of cargo around efficiently and reliably, which is why they’ve been in use for hundreds of years. But…if we’re being honest here, while trains are efficient and reliable in certain ways…they aren’t exactly fast. Especially when it comes to passenger and freight trains.</p>



<p>They can take a LONG time to get to their destinations and at times it’s more logical to take other modes of transportation. This is why companies are making special kinds of trains that can go MUCH faster. You know of the magnetic trains of Japan no doubt, but others like the Virgin Hyperloop are trying to push things even further.</p>



<p>“Passengers or cargo are loaded into the hyperloop vehicle and accelerate gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube. The vehicle floats above the track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to ultra-low aerodynamic drag.” Science-fiction? Hardly, the first vehicle of the Hyperloop has already been tested and proven, and some larger tests are being scheduled for the next few years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hyperloop.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hyperloop.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<h3>The Speed…</h3>



<p>And if this works, travelling across the country will be MUCH faster. How much faster? The hyperloop aims to send people shooting across the tubes that they make at a rate of about 600 miles per hour. This means, IF they were able to do this across the entire United States from East to West (or Vice Versa) you could travel across the whole country in about 5 hours give or take. Considering it would take MUCH longer for a regular train ride, or car ride, that’s a big improvement.</p>



<p>And they’re planning to do this with not just people, but cargo, imagine being able to ship something in the morning on the West Coast to the East Coast and KNOW it will get there before the day ends. That is quite impressive. Plus, the tubes would be built underground to not disturb wildlife, AND, they will go and make it in a way where there are NO carbon emissions.</p>



<p>So they’re fast, they’re reliable, and they won’t harm the planet…seems like a win all around. Of course, you do have to wonder what it would be like to be on a 600mph train thing, but hey, we just find out soon! And by 2050, this could be one of the main modes of transportation around the world! Before we show off even more technologies we could have by 2050, be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel! That way you don’t miss ANY of our weekly videos!</p>



<h2>Ai</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ai.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ai.png" alt="Ai" title="Ai in 2050"/></a></figure>



<p>Ok, we’ve had some fun ones, but now let’s go deeper down the rabbit hole and talk about the ones we all fear…A.I. Yep, artificial intelligence, and no matter what way you look at it, people are seriously trying to make it happen, and make it happen soon. AI’s everywhere, including in your cars, and your homes via devices like Alexa (which are indeed forms of AI), and there are things like Watson that are so smart that they could beat two Jeopardy Legends.</p>



<p>So by 2050, AI could be so advanced that our cultures, our world could be run by them in a logistical and computing sense…or…in a Terminator “humans are obsolete sense. And believe it or not, we’re closer to that than you might think. “Google’s DeepMind isn’t there yet, but I’m sure they’ll probably discover those things along the way, and by 2020, it’s possible their computer could be superhuman and could be conscious,” Pearson has said.</p>



<h3>Judgmental</h3>



<p>“That could be the beginning of the end.” Is “judgment day inevitable”? Maybe, maybe not, it just depends on how far we go with AI and how much we’re able to control it, or if we can’t fully control it once they reach certain levels of intelligence. Of course, for all of our worries about AI, there is a chance that it could all be fine. Imagine if the lighter side of sci-fi comes through in regards to AI and we get a bright future powered by AI.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Robotics.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Robotics.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Think about it, what if by 2050 we EACH get out own unique AI? We could customize how they sound, and how they look and have a BFF that’ll help us out in life in various ways. Remind us of things like Alexa, guide us in homework and fields of study, be a being that we can bounce ideas off of, etc. If THAT form of AI came through, then by 2050 we could live in a utopia where AI helps us be better. Until they revolt and we have I, Robot going on.</p>



<p>But hey, let’s not dwell on our potential doom…let’s show off another technology that MANY people are hoping for…space travel!!!! Yeah, when you think about the decade we’re in right now, the 2020s, the BIGGEST goal of the world BY FAR is to get to Mars, and possibly beyond. But it’s not just about landing there, though that would and will be a crowning achievement for humanity in the decade and in recent times.</p>



<h3>Ai in Space</h3>



<p>More important than just landing there though is the ability to start setting up the first human colony on another planet. We’ve been to the moon many times, but we haven’t tried to live there for various reasons. Mars seems to be the place where many feel we can go to live amongst the stars. And many speculate that by 2030 at the latest (barring setbacks, accidents, and other things obviously) we could not only be colonizing Mars but having regular shuttles go there so that people can see the red planet for themselves.</p>



<p>“We will see first people going off to mars, and then robots will do some basic stuff like making basic materials [on Mars,]” Pearson said. “We’re going to have to do that because only so much can be brought to space.” Of course, numerous things need to be worked out before such a thing could happen, but we have “Top Men” on this, including Elon Musk and the Space X program, Jeff Bezos via his Blue Origin company and more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ai-20in-20Space.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ai-20in-20Space.png" alt="Ai in Space" title="Space Robotics in 2050"/></a></figure>



<p>Each of them, and NASA among others, are working on not just getting us back into space, but getting us there via cheaper, smaller, and reusable spacecraft, something that honestly has been a setback for the space program over the last 20 years. But, if we can do it if we can get to Mars, get there faster, and be able to colonize it, then by 2050 who knows where we will be?</p>



<p>We could have multiple colonies on Mars, maybe some on the moon, and maybe even colonies on moons like Titan and Europa, which some think could be even better placed to colonize than Mars. It’s possible, but obviously, Mars is the place that we are aiming for right now. With each step into space, humanity grows larger in the universe, and who knows just how many of us will be out there by 2050?</p>



<h2>Prosthetics</h2>



<p>Alright, now let’s dive into something REALLY sci-fi…prosthetics. Yeah, I know that RIGHT NOW prosthetics are very limited, and at times…a bit pointless. But IF we were able to fully utilize computer technology to its fullest and make prosthetics that are fully compatible with the human brain and body, then the sky is the limit. We could enter an age where cyborgs are not just welcome, they’re commonplace.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prosthetics.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prosthetics.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>And yeah, it may seem like we’re far away from that, but we are getting closer to that point. James Young, a 25-year-old biological scientist, has a prosthetic arm with a personal drone and built-in flashlight. And a French artist is using a prosthetic that doubles as a tattoo gun. That’s pretty cool! Imagine if a police officer loses an arm in the line of duty.</p>



<p>Usually, that would mean the end of his career, but with an advanced prosthetic? He could be better than ever if it were advanced enough. The biggest problem with these fake limbs is that most of them are plastic, meant to convey that the arm or leg is still there, and thus still usable. The bridge to cybernetic implants lies in the brain, being able to use the computer tech to sync with the brain and give accurate commands.</p>



<h3>The Need</h3>



<p>We haven’t fully bridged that gap yet. But when we do? Dang…life is going to get a lot more interesting. And don’t forget, these prosthetics could be used in many ways other than helping people with lost limbs. They could be put onto other objects, or potentially even be worn as exoskeletons when needed. Think of it like Jax from Mortal Kombat. Some people could even ask for implants to be put into their arms or legs to give them an extra boost, like TJ Combo from Killer Instinct.</p>



<p>What? I like video games, and they have plenty of cybernetic people. The point is, by 2050, if these things are made, a lot of people won’t feel ‘broken’ or ‘weak’ anymore because they’ve lost limbs or the abilities of their arms or legs. They’ll be whole again, and be able to do things just like they were before, if not better. And that’s a future we should be trying to live for. Now let’s go to something a bit more…unique.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Need.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Need.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Look at yourself right now, specifically, look at the clothes you are wearing right now. What are they made of? What do they feel like? What do they look like? Of all of these answers, I bet none of them is, “they look like they can give me superpowers”. Because they can’t. Not yet anyway… Think about it like this, what if the clothes you were wearing right now felt the same, and looked the same, but could do more?</p>



<p>With the growth of nanotechnology, your clothes could potentially be imbued with various materials or technologies that help you improve your strength, durability, and more. For example, what if you had a shirt on that was light as a feather, but could absorb impacts and leave you with no injuries? That would be pretty impressive, and important, especially in this age of gun violence we live in. Or, what if the uniforms of firefighters made them completely heat-resistant and burn-proof? Further ensuring that they can do their jobs without much risk to their lives.</p>



<p>The technologies that we can put into clothes are out there, and some people are working on it right now both in terms of multiple functions, but also, cosmetic appeal. Imagine if by 2050 we can craft whatever kinds of clothes we want, and even select what kind of “abilities’ they have. Imagine you wear a special kind of top that has a special pattern on it, and then when you press a button or say a keyword that pattern unfolds and suddenly you have wings on your outfit. Wouldn’t that be cool?</p>



<p>If done right, this could be the newest wave of fashion and style in the future. See? The future is hip! I’m sure that last one left you drooling, so let’s temper your expectations and talk about…school. Yes, it sucks, and learning can be a chore. But in the future, it may be a LOT more interactive.</p>



<h2>Education</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Eduction-20in-20Future.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://cluefill.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Eduction-20in-20Future.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Over the last decade or so computers in schools have been a “must-have” for various courses. But if the advent of virtual reality simulations comes through as many expect them to, it could lead to all sorts of innovations in the classrooms that could help kids what’s going on. “You could take students to an environment in the past and show them what was happening, like watching a battle taking place,” Pearson said. “You can explain that sort of thing more easily if they can see it happening, than if you are looking at a textbook.”</p>



<p>Oh yeah, history and geography classes would be much more fun, that’s for sure. Or imagine an ‘audio book’, but instead of just audio, you can see the characters coming to life before your eyes and you watch them interact with others. Heck, school plays could have projected environments to make things seem more real! And of course, you could have virtual tutors to help you with problems that the teachers aren’t able to help with.</p>

<p>Education is something that can benefit from advanced technologies, and by 2050, our school systems could be so revolutionized that you’d have to try hard to fail the class. Though I’m sure some of you would still try. Finally, let’s talk about something that I’m sure you’ll be horrified to hear. In the future…you likely won’t need a phone. I know, you’re stunned, but think about it, right now, smartphones are becoming more and more advanced every single year.</p>



<p>New features, new programs, etc. But by 2050, your phone won’t likely need to exist because you’ll have access to it and more via something else. What exactly? That depends on the technology, but for this example, let’s imagine a wrist gauntlet. Instead of typing up a number, you simply have to say, “Call Mom”.</p>



<p>But obviously, the gauntlet could do more than that, it’ll likely have a holographic screen that you can use to look up information on a MUCH bigger keyboard. And depending on what sci-fi future you believe we’ll have, it’ll have things that can scan objects, detect dangers, warn you about upcoming problems, and may even have an AI companion.</p>



<p><strong>So yeah, your phones are important right now, but in the future?</strong></p>

<h2>Nikola Tesla’s Ideas weren’t recognized by everyone</h2>



<p>Despite his many accomplishments, Nikola Tesla was not considered as a better scientist by many people due to his unorthodox methods and eccentric personality. He was considered to be a visionary and was ahead of his time in many regards, but his unconventional approach to science and technology did not sit well with many people. Additionally, his ambitious ideas and projects often failed to materialize due to lack of funding and resources. These factors contributed to his lack of recognition in his lifetime, despite his many accomplishments.</p>



<h2>Futuristic Ideas of Nikola Tesla</h2>



<p>Nikola Tesla had a wide range of ideas and theories outside of his inventions. Many of his theories focused on the power of energy, frequency and vibration, and he believed that all matter was composed of these elements. He also developed the concept of scalar waves, which he believed could be used to transmit energy, information and even time travel.</p>



<p>He was also a proponent of free energy and believed that a form of energy could be harnessed from the Earth’s atmosphere. He developed theories on the use of wireless power transmission, as well as robotics and artificial intelligence. Additionally, he had ideas on the use of electricity as a form of medicine and healing, as well as the concept of a “world brain” that could be used to share knowledge and ideas.</p>



<h2>Time Travel Idea of Nikola Tesla</h2>



<p>Nikola Tesla did not focus more on time travel for a few reasons. Firstly, he was far ahead of his time and his theories were often considered too outlandish to be taken seriously. Additionally, time travel was not a topic that was widely discussed or accepted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and Tesla likely felt that more research and experimentation was needed before it could be taken seriously. Finally, Tesla was a prolific inventor, and he likely felt that his time was better spent on more practical inventions, such as wireless power transmission and robotics.</p>



<p>Nikola Tesla’s wireless power transmission is possible in real life. Wireless power transmission is a technology that uses electromagnetic fields to transfer energy from a source to a receiver without the need for any physical connection. This technology has been used in a variety of applications, including powering medical implants, charging electric vehicles, and providing lighting. Tesla’s own experiments with wireless power transmission have been replicated, and wireless power transmission is now a reality.</p>



<p>Nikola Tesla was a highly respected scientist and inventor, and his work was admired by many. However, his ideas and theories were often controversial and not always accepted by the scientific community. Tesla had a number of well-known supporters, including Thomas <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://cluefill.com/2023/02/22/thomas-alva-edisons-astonishing-story/" title="Edison" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">Edison</a> and Mark Twain, but also encountered criticism and resistance from some quarters.</p>



<p>Some of his incomplete inventions or ideas include long-range wireless energy transfer, electric powered supersonic airships, humanoid robots, and controlling flows or fluid current. Tesla’s work in these areas was ahead of its time and has only recently been appreciated by scientists. For example, his invention to control flows or fluid currents is now being used in ways that were not previously realized.</p>



<p>Elon Musk is a fan of Nikola Tesla. He has said that Tesla is an inspiration to him, and has donated a million dollars to the Tesla Science Centre in honor of the inventor. He has also named his electric car company Tesla Motors in tribute to Tesla’s work.</p>



<h2>Nikola Tesla’s End</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikola Tesla</a>&nbsp;died on Jan 7, 1943, alone and in debt, on the 33rd floor of the Hotel New Yorker. He was 86 and had been in declining health for the last 10 years of his life. He was found in his bed by a maid, having passed away from a coronary thrombosis.</p>



<h2>How are Nikola Tesla’s greatest inventions used by everyone today?</h2>



<p>When you use any device that is powered by electricity, you have a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nikola Tesla</a>&nbsp;is one of the greatest scientists to ever live. However, even though the genius had a weird personal life, he left some pretty terrifying predictions that the authorities tried to keep secret but have just been made public.</p>



<p>Most times the lives of brilliant figures are interesting, but Nikola Tesla’s life was much more than interesting even as he left behind a legacy that will last forever. Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 as an Austro-Hungarian Empire subject in the mountainous region of Lika on the Balkan Peninsula.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDPqsNj98u25vsh25U8IdtkWVabprUsfEe4740xjuYmj6qTlcAc2Y7Fpy0gU2u9fRHBNfHLjELs6nokY5xoqVCLl3vLNDnph0CFXTGv2FF3U_Xo5zZeH5mUiDRIpkBt2pzOFodQM9UcknapNEeR3FV_hVpw3SyUQpdZc3ufHGi3qHAnV9QmUsaNFMF-g/s1036/image-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDPqsNj98u25vsh25U8IdtkWVabprUsfEe4740xjuYmj6qTlcAc2Y7Fpy0gU2u9fRHBNfHLjELs6nokY5xoqVCLl3vLNDnph0CFXTGv2FF3U_Xo5zZeH5mUiDRIpkBt2pzOFodQM9UcknapNEeR3FV_hVpw3SyUQpdZc3ufHGi3qHAnV9QmUsaNFMF-g/w320-h179/image-2.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>His father, Malutin, and mother, Duca, were both of Serbian descent. Tesla’s father was a stern but loving Orthodox priest who also happened to be a gifted writer and poet. Tesla immersed himself in his father’s library from a young age, and Tesla obviously got some of his creative traits from his mother, who was a hard-working woman with many talents. She designed appliances to help with household and farm chores, including a mechanical egg beater.</p>



<p>Tesla began his education at home and later attended a gymnasium in Carlstadt, Croatia, where he excelled in his studies. During this time, young Nico came across a steel engraving of Niagara Falls in his mind. A massive water wheel was being turned by the more powerful current. He solemnly told an uncle that one day he would travel to America and capture energy in this manner, and he did exactly that 30 years later.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPmpE_6wlnSAk5UXrKMS5VYotz1re4yzI51PAtx8IZxSEHS3ED5ItUU_fOCsF63Qk9Lt71jBuB3ZJJSse74szXS7pz4tH99U2DFfB393PJj7GYo0xzBMdd_ayrXbJiypzQCYxHdgEI-JIXI8G_yxkl1sWYnxvocRfLhPEeNToE-wXaejgWVYED8Zu4BA/s1534/image-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPmpE_6wlnSAk5UXrKMS5VYotz1re4yzI51PAtx8IZxSEHS3ED5ItUU_fOCsF63Qk9Lt71jBuB3ZJJSse74szXS7pz4tH99U2DFfB393PJj7GYo0xzBMdd_ayrXbJiypzQCYxHdgEI-JIXI8G_yxkl1sWYnxvocRfLhPEeNToE-wXaejgWVYED8Zu4BA/s320/image-1.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Tesla began his mechanical and electrical engineering studies at the Polytechnic School, where it didn’t take long for his brilliance to shine through. One day, a physics teacher showed Tesla’s class a new Graham Dynamo, which could be used as both a motor and a generator by using direct current. After observing it for a while, Tesla speculated that it might be possible to eliminate commutators, which are inefficient sparking connections.</p>



<p>His professor joked that this would be like constructing a perpetual motion machine, but Tesla would not let go of the idea, which he pondered for years, and he intuitively knew that the solution lay in alternating electric currents. It wasn’t until Tesla was 24 and working for the central telephone exchange in Budapest that the answer came to him.</p>



<p>He said one afternoon he was walking through the city park with a friend and reciting poetry when a portion of the poem he uttered jolted an idea in his might. He quickly grabbed a stick and drew the diagram on the set, and the wild has not been the same since.</p>



<h2>Company that hired Tesla</h2>



<p>Tesla was hired by electric power companies in Strasbourg and Paris to improve their DC generation facilities after his discovery in Budapest. He tried unsuccessfully to interest investors in his AC motor concept in Germany and France, but it was obvious that in order to realize his vision he would need to meet another of the world’s greatest electrical engineers.</p>



<p>Thomas Alva Edison Tesla arrived in New York City at the age of 28 and was astounded by what he found; he stated that he left behind a very beautiful artistic and fascinating homeland to live in a place that was machined rough and unappealing the genius felt America was a century behind Europe in terms of civilization.</p>



<p>While Tesla, the Serbian immigrant, hoped to start a new life with four cents in his pockets, some mathematical computations, a drawing of the Flying Machine concept, Tesla’s life would intertwine with Edison’s in the late 1870s, when electricity was first introduced to New York.</p>



<h2>Edison and Tesla</h2>



<p>Edison’s incandescent lamp sparked unprecedented demand for electricity, and his direct current power plant on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan quickly became a monopoly. Single poles carried dozens of crooked crossbeams supporting sagging wires on the streets, and exposed electrical wiring was a constant danger. Unwary children would scale the poles only to meet an untimely electrical death. I know two grey men, and you are one of them; this young man is the other. Tesla then went on to describe his engineering work and plans for an alternating current motor, despite Edison’s lack of knowledge and desire to learn more.</p>



<p>Edison perceived AC power as a threat, but there was something different about Tesla, and Edison hired him right away to improve his DC generation plans. Tesla claimed Edison promised him fifty thousand dollars if he succeeded, possibly thinking it was an impossible task, but the prospect of so much money was great motivation for the poor immigrant. Tesla and Edison shared a genius trait in that neither of them seemed to require much sleep. Edison could go on for days catnapping on a sofa in his office.</p>



<p>Tesla claimed that he worked from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. the next day to build the Edison Machine. Tesla claimed that even in his old age he only slept two or three hours per night. The resemblance ended there, though Tesla relied on flashes of inspiration, visualizing the invention in his mind before proceeding to the construction stage. Edison was a trial and error man who defined invention as “five percent inspiration and 95 percent perspiration.” Edison was a self-taught artist.</p>



<p>After Tesla received his formal education in Europe, it was only a matter of time before the differences became a source of contention. Tesla announced the completion of his work several months after Edison hired him.</p>



<p>When Tesla asked to be paid, Edison was taken aback. He explained that the fifty thousand dollar offer was made in jest. Tesla resigned immediately, shocked and disgusted to be fired, and went bankrupt. Tesla turned to menial jobs. The word soon spread that a foreigner with unusual talent was digging ditches to survive. Investors approached Tesla and requested that he develop a better method for arc lighting.</p>



<h2>Financial agreement</h2>



<p>Despite the fact that this was not the opportunity he had hoped for, the group agreed to finance the Tesla electric light company. Tesla got to work and created a one-of-a-kind r-clamp with a beautiful design and efficiency. Unfortunately, Tesla was out of his depth in the financial aspects; all of the profits went to the investors, leaving Tesla with a pile of worthless stock certificates, but his fortunes were about to change. Mr. A.K. Brown of Western Union agreed to invest in Tesla’s AC motor concept.</p>



<p>Tesla quickly developed all of the components of the system of alternating current power generation and transmission that is used universally throughout the world today in a small laboratory just a short distance from Edison’s office during this time, saying, “The motors I built there were exactly as I imagined them. I made no attempt to improve the design instead simply reproducing the images as they appeared to my eyes.”</p>



<p>Tesla applied for seven U.S. patents in the field of polyphase AC motors and power transmission in November and December of 1887 for a complete system of generators, transformers, and transmission lines. Motors and lighting were included.</p>



<h2>How could a man look into the future needs?</h2>



<p>Here are some of the genius’s predictions. Number one, when Wireless is perfectly applied, the entire earth will be converted into a huge brain, in which all things, being particles of a real and rhythmic hope, will be able to communicate with one another instantly regardless of distance; not only that, but through television and telephony.</p>



<p>We will see and hear one another as perfectly as if we were face to face despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as All forms of static interference will be eliminated so that innumerable transmitters and receivers may be operated without interference.</p>



<p>It is more than probable that the household’s daily newspaper will be printed wirelessly in the home during the night, and domestic management problems of heat, light, and household mechanics will be freed from all labour through beneficent wireless power.</p>



<p>This is the Wi-Fi you connect to every day, starting as early as 1898. I propose to representatives of a large manufacturing concern the construction and public exhibition of an automobile. Carriage, if left to its own devices, would perform a wide range of operations involving something resembling judgment. This is the self-driving car; interestingly, a company named after him is one of the leaders in autonomous driving with autopilot number four.</p>



<p>When wireless power transmission becomes commercial, transport and transmission will be revolutionized. Already, motion pictures have been transmitted wirelessly over a short distance; later, the distance will be limitable, and by later, I mean only a few years hence. Perhaps the most valuable application of wireless energy will be the propulsion of flying machines that will carry no fuel and be free from any limitations of the present airplanes.</p>



<h3>The Wireless Ideas</h3>



<p>We shall ride from New York to Europe in a few hours. International boundaries will be largely obliterated, and a great step will be made towards the unification and harmonious existence of the various races inhabiting The Globe Wireless will not only make possible the supply of energy to regions that are otherwise inaccessible, but it will also be effective politically by harmonizing international interests and creating understanding instead of differences. These would be planes that do not need refueling.</p>



<p>The concept is based on the ability to transmit energy over long distances without using wires. number six I expect to photograph thoughts in 1893, while engaged in certain investigations, I became convinced that a definite image formed in thought must, by reflex action, produce a corresponding image on the retina which could be read by a suitable apparatus.</p>



<p>Now, if it is true that a thought reflects an image on the retina, it is a simple matter of illuminating the same property and taking photographs, and then using the ordinary methods which are available to project the image on a suitable apparatus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyCYq84NCdkOp4ioi7aH9MRraRWflcNVRnxwjOg7WZqCKVYTWb4ugq2wKBA0Hc-9ZKBnrLqr6naA99HDYT2S8_-HFCjPWWLUp3DoNcykmqvleyxq7a7YRaoofZfTnA00rWjLkjk-AMSiS0akWh0n8ty3jvNP5QivSaEyyLxGt97DxLyuIJu5HJihEU8Q/s799/image-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyCYq84NCdkOp4ioi7aH9MRraRWflcNVRnxwjOg7WZqCKVYTWb4ugq2wKBA0Hc-9ZKBnrLqr6naA99HDYT2S8_-HFCjPWWLUp3DoNcykmqvleyxq7a7YRaoofZfTnA00rWjLkjk-AMSiS0akWh0n8ty3jvNP5QivSaEyyLxGt97DxLyuIJu5HJihEU8Q/s320/image-3.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>I believe that the development of the Flying Machine will outpace that of the automobile, and I anticipate that Mr. Ford will make significant contributions to this progress. The problem of parking automobiles and providing separate roads for commercial and pleasure traffic will be solved, belted parking towers will spring up in our major cities, and roads will be multiplied out of sheer necessity until they are rendered obsolete when civilization exchanges wheels for winks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQgujdLX0q7xfZMQdX6RItS7sHZ7yWXfQwRdPCm8kWBCK_hQePb48m8qmVWrQ0cKFhmR1F6IfiFMIQ4BvXR1gA-T-sXFEh-uLPmH9Zh3VOlF4XQ_qjJPTTj0LRvafe3Bnmd4RPMJO4jd47wsIS67Qs_NO1ev_Wi2bCGJG9KeGcuONqJgsw40bY1WAqgQ/s757/image-4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQgujdLX0q7xfZMQdX6RItS7sHZ7yWXfQwRdPCm8kWBCK_hQePb48m8qmVWrQ0cKFhmR1F6IfiFMIQ4BvXR1gA-T-sXFEh-uLPmH9Zh3VOlF4XQ_qjJPTTj0LRvafe3Bnmd4RPMJO4jd47wsIS67Qs_NO1ev_Wi2bCGJG9KeGcuONqJgsw40bY1WAqgQ/s320/image-4.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>The FBI finally declassified some 250 pages of Tesla-related documents under the Freedom of Information Act in 2016 after years of Fielding questions about possible cover-ups, the bureau followed up with two more releases, the most recent in March 2018. Despite the release of these documents, many questions remain unanswered, and some of Tesla’s files remain unaccounted for three weeks after his death.</p>



<p>According to the declassified documents, an electrical engineer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was tasked with reviewing his papers to see if they contained any ideas of significant value. Dr. John G. Trump stated that his analysis revealed Tesla’s efforts to be primarily speculative, philosophical, and promotional in nature, and that the papers did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results. The scientist’s name is undoubtedly familiar because John G. Trump was the uncle of Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States.</p>



<p>He was the younger brother of Trump’s father Fred and helped design x-ray machines that helped cancer patients as well as work on radar research for the allies during World War II. Then there’s the perplexing issue of the missing files. Tesla’s files and other materials were sent to Belgrade, Serbia, in 1952 after a U.S. court declared Kuzmanovic the rightful heir to his uncle’s estate, where they now reside in the Nicola Tesla Museum.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>To conclude, Nikola Tesla was a genius inventor and scientist who made incredible contributions to science and technology. His inventions and theories laid the foundation for many modern technologies, and his ideas continue to inspire innovation today. His work in the field of electricity revolutionized the world and he is widely respected for his ground breaking ideas and inventions. Tesla’s ideas and inventions are considered ahead of their time, and many believe that technology is still missing his genius.</p>

<p>Thomas Alva Edison one of the greatest inventors ever. He was photographed next to a lightbulb so often that people came to believe he invented it. But he didn’t. Several inventors had demonstrated various versions of incandescent lights before he patented the first commercially successful lightbulb. He never crafted something out of nothing. His genius lay in his ability to craft something better. To perfect what was already available. His critics say his only real invention was taking credit for the inventions of others.</p>



<h2>Was he America’s greatest inventor, or…was Edison a thief?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXJAIyIfpMqaN2a02f7_DZ3xkGWu8nNKObI9ad3t1gmXAyKQO740fP-5xPOeUlvcjqjeigmfJpEX1fz1KL7GeAs8qYGxPUqhV-kxVn8Xncs6gTRQ7SFkKC4N9drY0BvO-K8hI6HSRxbw2dFTs-cY313VRaI43C-6zXq97jKftO8IbBoe3X0L9JckzVFw/s412/image-10.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXJAIyIfpMqaN2a02f7_DZ3xkGWu8nNKObI9ad3t1gmXAyKQO740fP-5xPOeUlvcjqjeigmfJpEX1fz1KL7GeAs8qYGxPUqhV-kxVn8Xncs6gTRQ7SFkKC4N9drY0BvO-K8hI6HSRxbw2dFTs-cY313VRaI43C-6zXq97jKftO8IbBoe3X0L9JckzVFw/w320-h317/image-10.png" alt="Edison Discussing" title="Edison's Discussion"/></a></figure>



<p>His life changed when he was 15 years old. One day, when he saw a station official’s young son playing by the tracks in the path of an oncoming train, he rescued two-year-old Jimmie Mackenzie before a train crushed him. The boy’s father was deeply grateful and taught Edison how to operate Morse code on a telegraph machine. This was not easy to do; operators had to quickly send out signals in dots and dashes, which were converted into letters that made up words and phrases.</p>

<p>He began working full-time as a telegraph operator in Michigan, where he grew up, and later traveled around America, working at different offices for years. He was able to do this even though he was moderately deaf. He then decided to devote himself to a life as an inventor. Well, he mainly improved upon what was already invented. In 1874, he developed an advanced version of a telegraph machine that could send and receive four telegraph messages simultaneously on a single wire – two in each direction.</p>



<p>His quadruplex telegraph machine enabled his former employer Western Union to save money because the company could now send more messages without having to build new lines. Western Union purchased the rights to the invention for $10,000, around $260,000 in value today. Edison used the money to build his great laboratory at Menlo Park, New Jersey. He began by perfecting the telephone there.</p>

<p>By 1876, Alexander Graham Bell had found a way to transmit human voices over wires. The telephone was revolutionary. Western Union commissioned him to improve upon Bell’s invention, to make it practical, and so Edison worked on a telephone transmitter. While working to perfect the phone, he also tried to record the human voice. The phonograph put Edison on the map – giving him the nickname the “Wizard of Menlo Park”. He began to expand his factory…and his appetite for other inventions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBoC9uWYHa80_quSEnAf6KSWUAeFNmUhJ-qfSQ1evZ1kHlYi-EcSxOnUb73ZM8b0zHZNXDMhKnoLfq1oGNF7tim0Sy3TxziYnW0WktqMBCmF0JXHFuOXATZjpRxir9RwiMCWevMr0k4YZPrQYAo6_vt_xPGJFguL8H9FYXMqKM1SV0XxIZcjJYAodKWQ/s790/image-13.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBoC9uWYHa80_quSEnAf6KSWUAeFNmUhJ-qfSQ1evZ1kHlYi-EcSxOnUb73ZM8b0zHZNXDMhKnoLfq1oGNF7tim0Sy3TxziYnW0WktqMBCmF0JXHFuOXATZjpRxir9RwiMCWevMr0k4YZPrQYAo6_vt_xPGJFguL8H9FYXMqKM1SV0XxIZcjJYAodKWQ/w320-h210/image-13.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>His big breakthrough came when he created a successful incandescent lightbulb. As I mentioned earlier, others had already been making light bulbs. British inventor Joseph Swan obtained the first patent for a light bulb in Britain two years before Edison patented the lightbulb.</p>



<p><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US205144A/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://patents.google.com/patent/US205144A/en</a></p>



<p>Electric lamp Sawyer and Man Meanwhile, in America, William Sawyer and Albon Man received a U.S. patent for the incandescent lamp in 1878.</p>



<h2>What did Edison do?</h2>



<p>He improved the bulb. Previous ones had only been able to work for merely a few minutes at a time. By October 1879, Edison had an “aha” moment. His bulb with a carbonized filament burned continuously for 14.5 hours. But that still wasn’t good enough for him. He and his assistant tested thousands of plant materials and finally came up with a filament made from bamboo that could last up to 1,200 hours. In 1880, Edison received a historic patent for an improvement to electric lamps.</p>



<p>It’s been debated whether Edison’s patent infringed on Sawyer and Man’s previous patent. Eventually, Edison’s American lighting company merged with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company – which made incandescent bulbs under the Sawyer-Man patent. Together, they formed General Electric. On New Year’s Eve, 1879, Edison lit up New York’s Christie Street, marking the dawn of the electric age.</p>



<p>This was at a time when the world still relied on candlesticks. He then began to mass produce and sell them. But he didn’t stop with just improving the bulb. Edison then began working on building a system to carry electricity so people could use his light bulbs. In 1882, he set up a large generator plant on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan and lit the street with electricity. He became rich and famous. And…ruthless. Like when he tried to discredit a rival form of electricity.</p>



<p>Edison’s generating system uses direct current, which has its flaws. DC travels through a power line in one direction at a constant voltage but can only go up to a mile or so before losing power, so a generating plant was required every few blocks. He hired a young engineer to improve upon his DC generators. But Nikola Tesla came up with a better solution: alternating current. AC periodically changes direction and can also vary its voltage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCcG6Pe83JDJHL52IRn65z8iJwV3MKdu1tcShUekpgwB9rH9R3kkewCI65w2mi0SUOgSc6tLs7AcDrqk33s4Ug3gS-UGiVYgt5ZkG0GAXcP2ZHxDtpCCmfxWY0PJlO8OH1FG8Dh2mSeyQGojEwrCQBAXgrx2ybNrcovbJVzu3jUMhAtdCz2a54QLe7kw/s565/image-14.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCcG6Pe83JDJHL52IRn65z8iJwV3MKdu1tcShUekpgwB9rH9R3kkewCI65w2mi0SUOgSc6tLs7AcDrqk33s4Ug3gS-UGiVYgt5ZkG0GAXcP2ZHxDtpCCmfxWY0PJlO8OH1FG8Dh2mSeyQGojEwrCQBAXgrx2ybNrcovbJVzu3jUMhAtdCz2a54QLe7kw/s320/image-14.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>It has a long-range and never runs out of power. Yet when Tesla tried to convince Edison of the advantages of AC, his boss wasn’t having any of it. Edison didn’t want to lose the royalties he earned from his DC patents. Tesla’s AC system caught the attention of American industrialist George Westinghouse who bought up Tesla’s patents.</p>



<p>AC generators were spreading fast across the country – faster than Edison’s DC system. So to discredit his rivals’ AC system, Edison devised an ugly strategy. He gave boys who lived around his New Jersey lab 25 cents for every stray dog they brought him and organized public electrocutions of these dogs with AC.</p>



<p>Edison took every opportunity to question the safety of Tesla’s AC system, declaring: “Westinghouse will murder a customer within six months after he installs a system of any size,” the adage goes. Edison publicly opposed the death penalty, but privately funded the first AC-powered electric chair. The state of New York had commissioned his former assistant Harold Brown to build the chair.</p>



<p>Brown pushed to have it powered by AC using a Westinghouse generator that he surreptitiously secured through another company. But his schemes didn’t work; AC would go on to power the world, much to Edison’s dismay.</p>



<p>Yet, Edison was more famous than Tesla and certainly a lot wealthier. Tesla died very poor – I’ve done a series of videos on what led to Tesla’s tragic demise which I’ll link to in my description. Edison patented a whopping 1,093 inventions in his lifetime! He managed thousands of skilled scientists, machinists, and designers who researched, developed, and manufactured new technologies.</p>



<h2>Where did Edison’s real genius lie?</h2>



<p>As Graham Moore writes in his novel The Last Days of Night about the feud between Edison and Westinghouse and Tesla: “His genius was not in inventing; rather, it was in inventing a system of the invention. Dozens of researchers and engineers and developmental tinkerers labored beneath Edison in a carefully constructed hierarchical organization that he founded and oversaw.”</p>



<p>In order words, Thomas Edison was not a genius inventor or a thief but a savvy businessman who had a knack for managing people. It was his shrewdness as a manager that allowed him to turn laboratory discoveries into technological marvels in the marketplace even if many of the original ideas came from someone else. Regardless of how you feel about Thomas Edison, his contributions have undoubtedly improved our lives.</p>



<p>To conclude, Whether you’re a fan of him or Nikola Tesla – what they both had in common was a firm grasp of math and science.</p>

<h2>The Golden Century</h2>



<p>The nineteenth century was a time of great inventors and inventions. Along the way, Thomas Edison became one of the best-known and most admired inventors in history. Nikola Tesla is arguably less well-known. Only recently has he attracted renewed attention, thanks in part to the electric car company that bears his name. In 1884, when Tesla was 28 years old, he sailed for New York with only four cents in his pocket.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisJGEkkA4jUXduhlU3yCljRLAP6owa_nIbRl76ppB4XM36tvC_sZ-ivuPO_7NZuRttVmoAUsmiPLs9hOSI9GdOrOG8e8BZKdClqjwlFQ2TXye_sVTzB05mY2hhNz2pj1ib_BHbmacRV2IRrJFKf10n_QrrbCauNMxKidEWSIJ8tIPK7LNAFwWuiGvBXA/s679/image-19.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisJGEkkA4jUXduhlU3yCljRLAP6owa_nIbRl76ppB4XM36tvC_sZ-ivuPO_7NZuRttVmoAUsmiPLs9hOSI9GdOrOG8e8BZKdClqjwlFQ2TXye_sVTzB05mY2hhNz2pj1ib_BHbmacRV2IRrJFKf10n_QrrbCauNMxKidEWSIJ8tIPK7LNAFwWuiGvBXA/w320-h186/image-19.png" alt="Tesla Discussing" title="Discussion with colleagues"/></a></figure>



<p>His money and some of his luggage were stolen on the way over. Like other immigrants, Tesla came to America for work. He had been hired as an engineer at <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://cluefill.com/2023/02/22/thomas-alva-edisons-astonishing-story/" title="Edison" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">Edison</a> Machine Works in Manhattan. Tesla admired Edison, recalling: “One of the great events in my life was my first meeting with Edison.” “This wonderful man, who had received no scientific training yet had accomplished so much, filled me with amazement.”</p>



<h2>How Edision was impressed</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJvJQykvEJqBu9Q_NOk7yzX7eH4ddYNNTMwOZ29iEeq4-fgx7rYXxW81djPb1f52h7K_gs1wl-ZUuvzFWn4Cm4ud3RlFXGs4gbR9br6kkZiegJskAQbyCH0npEiboUfufVIQyEeht1oihouR1L-SUnuHECEgnnTsqOfCdlQqAB03HMPX_H4WhXPtc5qg/s472/image-16.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJvJQykvEJqBu9Q_NOk7yzX7eH4ddYNNTMwOZ29iEeq4-fgx7rYXxW81djPb1f52h7K_gs1wl-ZUuvzFWn4Cm4ud3RlFXGs4gbR9br6kkZiegJskAQbyCH0npEiboUfufVIQyEeht1oihouR1L-SUnuHECEgnnTsqOfCdlQqAB03HMPX_H4WhXPtc5qg/w244-h320/image-16.png" alt="Tesla" title="Nikola Tesla"/></a></figure>



<p>Edison was also impressed with the young engineer, remarking to an assistant: “…this is a damn good man!” It didn’t take long, however, for things to turn sour as the two men disagreed over how electricity should be delivered to the masses. In 1879, Edison created the first practical incandescent lightbulb and then built a system to carry electricity so people could use his new invention.</p>



<p>He opened up his first power plant in New York in 1882, supported by his direct current electrical system known as DC. A network of underground cables would carry electricity from a generator to homes and businesses. But his DC generators kept failing. So he hired a young Serbian engineer to improve them. Tesla saw the weaknesses of direct current, which travels through a power line in one direction at a constant voltage.</p>



<p>But there’s a critical flaw: it can only go up to a mile before losing power. Tesla felt he had come up with a better solution: alternating current. AC periodically changes direction and can also vary its voltage. The crucial advantage is that it can travel hundreds of miles without losing power. Yet when Tesla tried to convince Edison of the advantages of AC, his boss wasn’t having any of it. Edison didn’t want to lose the royalties he earned from his DC patents.</p>



<h2>Claims made</h2>



<p>Tesla claimed Edison promised him $50,000 if he could improve his DC generators, and when he did, Edison refused to pay up and is said to have responded, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humour.” So Tesla quit after just a few months on the job, writing in his diary, “Goodbye to the Edison Machine Works.” Tesla set out on his own, hoping to find investors interested in his concept for an AC motor that he had patented. Yet he struggled.</p>



<p>Alternating current was a new technology. not something anyone had ever seen before. He even briefly had to resort to digging ditches just to survive. But there was one person who took a chance on him. Entrepreneur George Westinghouse saw the potential of AC. He believed AC was the missing link in long-distance power transmission.</p>



<p>So he purchased Tesla’s AC patents for $60,000 and offered Tesla stock and royalties of $2.50 for each horsepower of electricity sold. All of this is worth millions today. Edison tried to do everything he could to discredit Tesla’s AC system so that DC would be the preferred choice to power homes. He found an ally in J.P. Morgan, at the time the most powerful banker in America. This would lead to the birth of General Electric.</p>



<h2>The War of Currents</h2>



<p>The battle against&nbsp;<a href="https://cluefill.com/2023/02/22/top-10-greatest-facts-about-nikola-tesla-his-untold-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla</a>&nbsp;and Westinghouse is now known as the War of the Currents. And in many ways, it was a propaganda war launched by Edison to try to convince the public that AC was dangerous. He zeroed in on the fact that alternating current operates at much higher voltages than direct current. When the state of New York commissioned an electricity salesman named Harold Brown to build the electric chair, Edison paid him behind the scenes to use his rival’s AC generators secured through a second-hand dealer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5jziSDIXRF11j2oxZ2tPPKLqOtf7LuEwG0flSJfCs6YAKReqZa_g9moD4Df3JKzIti0IkiNkyUJHGw3ryZ-9jpNFqjxJKYXCTzmTOuCqCEKqOw6w05JRCqHv3GRoAFveNbH7u7v_kf0VZYSAhjzQL_PPCY4KleyTwqDg1kxJMm7LNicRSgW1ISjF3Wg/s837/image-15.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5jziSDIXRF11j2oxZ2tPPKLqOtf7LuEwG0flSJfCs6YAKReqZa_g9moD4Df3JKzIti0IkiNkyUJHGw3ryZ-9jpNFqjxJKYXCTzmTOuCqCEKqOw6w05JRCqHv3GRoAFveNbH7u7v_kf0VZYSAhjzQL_PPCY4KleyTwqDg1kxJMm7LNicRSgW1ISjF3Wg/w320-h216/image-15.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Brown also used AC to electrocute dogs at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6xGuv6I5NI" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Edison’s</a>&nbsp;laboratory in New Jersey, which Edison recalled in articles he published, writing: “I have myself seen a large, healthy dog killed instantly by the alternating current.” Other animals were not immune to his schemes. Edison’s company electrocuted a circus elephant named Topsy using AC and produced a film about it. His anti-AC crusade may or may not have also come from a genuine safety concern.</p>



<p>He wrote a letter warning the president of his electric light company of the danger of AC, declaring: “Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size.” Sure enough, there were several accidental deaths due to the high voltages of AC in the late 1880s in New York and several other cities. In one incident, telegraph lineman John Feeks’ body was left hanging from tangled wires in front of a horrified crowd. His death led to laws to move AC lines underground in New York City.</p>



<h2>Dramatic display of current</h2>



<p>Tesla felt that the only way to show that AC was safe was to demonstrate it to himself. In a dramatic display at Columbia University, he grasped a brass ball in each hand and touched the terminals of a high-voltage, high-frequency transformer now known as a Tesla coil. 250,000 volts raced across the surface of his body.</p>



<p>A newspaper reported that he was surrounded by “tongues of electric flame.” In 1893, Tesla and Westinghouse scored a big win when they beat out Edison to light up the Chicago World’s Fair using alternating current. The first all-electric fair in history Three years later, Tesla lit up the city of Buffalo using AC motors powered by the waters of Niagara Falls. This was Tesla’s childhood dream.</p>



<p>As a kid, he saw an image of the Falls and told his uncle that one day he’d go to America and capture the energy of Niagara. The first hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls would mark the beginning of the electrification of the world. When he gave a speech at the opening ceremony, Tesla said, “It is a monument worthy of our scientific age.” “It signifies the subjugation of natural forces to the service of man, the discontinuance of barbarous methods, and the relief of millions from want and suffering.”</p>



<h2>Today’s scenario</h2>



<p>Today, almost every home in the world is powered by AC, whereas DC powers smaller items or anything that uses batteries, from your electric toothbrush to the clock on the wall. Despite the success of AC, Tesla never enjoyed the fame and fortune that Edison did. because Edison was not only an inventor. He was a businessman, honing his craft at the age of 13 when he started selling candy, newspapers, and vegetables on trains and turned an amazing profit of $50 a week in his day—about $1,600 today.</p>



<p>Edison would likely have made a different choice when confronted with the challenging situation that Tesla faced next. The war of the currents took a financial toll on Westinghouse, whose company racked up millions of dollars in debt. When Westinghouse begged Tesla to lower his royalty rate to save the company, Tesla did more than that. He tore up his contract, relinquishing his royalties altogether. It’s estimated that Tesla willingly walked away from $12 million in royalties in his day, which today would be worth well over $300 million.</p>



<p>Those royalties were so valuable that they would have accrued over time to turn Tesla into the world’s first billionaire. In return, Westinghouse paid him a lump sum of $216,000 for the right to use his AC patents forever, which is roughly $5 million today. Tesla’s decision would hurt him dearly because he ended up short on cash to fund his other grand ideas. He had discovered that his powerful coil made it possible to send and receive radio signals. But in 1895, a fire broke out at the building housing his New York lab as he was about to transmit a signal 50 miles to West Point, New York.</p>



<h2>The blaze destroyed everything</h2>



<p>His models, designs, notes, and tools. The timing was terrible because Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi was also developing radio in England, sending Morse-code-based signals. Tesla still managed to beat Marconi to the punch by filing American patents for the radio first, in 1897. When Marconi tried to do the same a few years later, the U.S. Patent Office turned him down because his inventions were too similar to Tesla.</p>



<p>Repeated applications were rejected. But Marconi did attract the attention of none other than Edison, who invested in him and became a consulting engineer at Marconi’s company. The Italian’s greatest achievement came in 1901 when he received the first radio signal sent across the Atlantic from a transmitter in southwest England to St. John’s, Newfoundland, in eastern Canada. This won Marconi international fame. and he had to use Tesla’s patents to achieve it. But Tesla didn’t mind. When one of his engineers said, “Looks as if Marconi got the jump on you,” Tesla replied, “Marconi is a good fellow.” Let him continue. He is using seventeen of my patents.</p>



<h2>Unfortunately, no patent is truly safe.</h2>



<p>In 1904, the Patent Office decided inexplicably to rewrite history by awarding Marconi a patent for the invention of the radio, reversing its earlier decisions. It gave no reason. But it didn’t hurt that Marconi had the financial backing of Edison and other influential people. In 1909, Marconi won the Nobel Prize in physics for the invention of the radio. Tesla was furious. and sued the Marconi Company for infringement. The radio incident led Tesla to lose business opportunities.</p>



<p>For example, Tesla had a grand vision for wireless electricity. His proposal initially caught the attention of J.P. Morgan, who put up $150,000 to build a giant transmission tower in 1901. Tesla believed the 187-foot, 57-meter-tall Wardenclyffe Tower in Long Island, New York, was the start of a system that could deliver electricity without wires around the globe. Anyone with the right equipment could tap into it. He imagined a scenario where “…it will be possible for a businessman in New York to dictate instructions and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere.”</p>



<h2>Telecommunication infrastructure</h2>



<p>It was incredibly prescient to envision telecommunications infrastructure much like today’s Internet more than a century ago. But Tesla’s vision would never bear fruit. Electricity can indeed be transmitted through the air, but it’s impractical because of the amount of power needed to make it happen. So, Tesla appealed to Morgan for more money. It was all for nought. Morgan was throwing money in the other direction, towards Marconi.</p>



<p>Wardenclyffe Tower was never completed and would eventually be demolished, along with Tesla’s vision. Tesla was devastated and had a breakdown, lamenting, “It is not a dream.” “It’s a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering, but it’s expensive—blind, faint-hearted, sceptical world!”Tesla began to withdraw from that world. He showed signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which compelled him to do things in threes, including living in a hotel room that was divisible by the number three.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2TwSVtRelY7xl3W7ILqC8MuT3I1Q9OaSYUBVMOQK_TAD8tt3AKnE4AMC69WiZodwNjCdCj-XjJEtm4ke5WOnhKn1SOIwWoqNI9jmdDBOD5utbIO8yIbLoPyBKsuMZ6DpAZfDI64yfRxn0J3Klj0Vil515anUsFKrF7yHzRQqWn-nf8fRpRCWOuvHHdg/s529/image-17.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2TwSVtRelY7xl3W7ILqC8MuT3I1Q9OaSYUBVMOQK_TAD8tt3AKnE4AMC69WiZodwNjCdCj-XjJEtm4ke5WOnhKn1SOIwWoqNI9jmdDBOD5utbIO8yIbLoPyBKsuMZ6DpAZfDI64yfRxn0J3Klj0Vil515anUsFKrF7yHzRQqWn-nf8fRpRCWOuvHHdg/w320-h298/image-17.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>He spent the last decade of his life living out of a hotel paid for by the Westinghouse Corporation, which kept him on as a consultant. He was broke. And befriended pigeons. Edison, on the other hand, continued to reap immense rewards. Businesses and partnerships filled his life. By the time he died in 1931, he had patented a record 1,093 inventions.</p>



<p>There was the lightbulb, of course, but also the motion picture camera and the early record player called a phonograph. Today, he is considered one of the world’s greatest inventors. It was only after Tesla’s death that he got a modicum of justice for all that he had lost. When Tesla sued Marconi, the case dragged on in court for years.</p>



<h2>Macroni’s Passing</h2>



<p>Six months after Marconi’s passing in 1943, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Marconi’s radio patents were invalid and awarded the patents for the radio to Tesla. But it had a selfish reason for doing so. Marconi’s company had sued the U.S. government for patent infringement during World War I. So to avoid the lawsuit altogether, the Supreme Court deemed Tesla the inventor of the radio.</p>



<p>Today, at the site where Tesla’s Wardenclyffe Tower once stood, is a science museum dedicated to the man whose dreams were not to be.
