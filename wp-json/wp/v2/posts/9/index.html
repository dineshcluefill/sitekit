Here is a brief overview of how Ezoic ad network works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Integration: Website owners integrate Ezoic ad network into their websites by adding nameservers on domain name provider, cloudflare and with wordpress plugin. Ezoic then automatically starts testing different ad placements and layouts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Testing: Ezoic uses machine learning algorithms to test different ad placements and layouts on a website to determine which combinations work best to increase user engagement and revenue.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optimization: Based on the results of the testing, Ezoic optimizes the website\u2019s layout and ad placements to achieve the best possible results.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ad Serving: Ezoic serves ads from multiple ad networks, including Google AdSense, through its platform. The platform uses real-time bidding (RTB) to ensure that the highest-paying ads are served to the website\u2019s visitors.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Data Analysis: Ezoic collects data on website visitors\u2019 behavior and uses it to optimize ad placement and layout further. This information helps website owners understand how users interact with their website and what can be done to improve their experience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Payment: Ezoic pays website owners a share of the revenue generated from ads served on their sites. The amount paid depends on factors such as the website\u2019s traffic, user engagement, and ad revenue generated.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Revenue_share_Payments\"><\/span>Revenue share &amp; Payments<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEhvwJrQVZcHXpOfZX8Js6RHHsrw2pSZGgagBB-6u8ofSJFnHkHrB93LUhAOtrihBdU0lIsMr35Vn25uWb2-MqKSnM-cPK0ON0v_9iOXtPzP3foJuZnaiWaEsbXaxR7GXZVgaSf_Y8Ag9KmBPMYHFLfQ3-4QYewYLTTeIFErBnkRuASirV9oeY85a0fkSg\/s1566\/Monetization.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEhvwJrQVZcHXpOfZX8Js6RHHsrw2pSZGgagBB-6u8ofSJFnHkHrB93LUhAOtrihBdU0lIsMr35Vn25uWb2-MqKSnM-cPK0ON0v_9iOXtPzP3foJuZnaiWaEsbXaxR7GXZVgaSf_Y8Ag9KmBPMYHFLfQ3-4QYewYLTTeIFErBnkRuASirV9oeY85a0fkSg\/w320-h159\/Monetization.png\" alt=\"Ezoic Monetization\" title=\"Ezoic revenue share\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ezoic pays its publishers a share of the revenue generated from the ads displayed on their website. The percentage of revenue share varies depending on the publisher\u2019s website traffic, user engagement, and ad revenue generated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ezoic uses a revenue share model, which means that a percentage of the revenue generated by the ads on the publisher\u2019s website is paid to the publisher. Ezoic takes a percentage of the revenue as its fee for providing the ad platform and optimization services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revenue share percentage is calculated based on a variety of factors, including the publisher\u2019s website traffic, ad revenue generated, user engagement metrics, and other factors. The exact formula used to calculate the revenue share is not disclosed by Ezoic, but it is designed to be fair and transparent to publishers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ezoic offers multiple payment options to its publishers, including PayPal, direct bank deposit, and wire transfer. Payments are typically made on a monthly basis, and the minimum payout threshold varies depending on the payment method chosen by the publisher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ezoic and Google AdSense are both ad networks that allow website owners to display ads on their websites and earn revenue from them. However, there are some differences between the two networks that may make one more suitable for a particular website or publisher than the other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ezoic_vs_Google_Adsense\"><\/span>Ezoic vs Google Adsense<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEhEl04G7flmg54TkL6pOIvCsybE9ln-eL8MBdMNHeHd2qEqzTvyMVWvRpZy9tYNO2flLJN0H4fJ3mKo92YvRStIuilh01_0556IjOtb76qmWVfpkQC3nd2HQ-4uyyDPm9Rc67RxUqzd0vvdcnfj-H8-9s42uTolryG3itqwWM7ISo9Rf7x0V39jixbmIA\/s1510\/Ezoic%20vs%20Adsense.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEhEl04G7flmg54TkL6pOIvCsybE9ln-eL8MBdMNHeHd2qEqzTvyMVWvRpZy9tYNO2flLJN0H4fJ3mKo92YvRStIuilh01_0556IjOtb76qmWVfpkQC3nd2HQ-4uyyDPm9Rc67RxUqzd0vvdcnfj-H8-9s42uTolryG3itqwWM7ISo9Rf7x0V39jixbmIA\/s320\/Ezoic%20vs%20Adsense.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some factors to consider when comparing Ezoic and Google AdSense:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ad optimization: Ezoic is known for its advanced\u00a0AI-based\u00a0optimization technology, which can automatically test and optimize ad placement and layout to increase user engagement and revenue. Google AdSense also offers some optimization features, but they may not be as advanced as Ezoic\u2019s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revenue share: Ezoic offers a revenue share model that can be more favorable to publishers than Google AdSense. Ezoic\u2019s revenue share percentage varies based on a variety of factors, but it can be higher than what is offered by Google AdSense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ad quality: Both networks strive to serve high-quality ads, but Ezoic offers some additional features to help screen and block low-quality ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Control: Ezoic provides publishers with more control over ad placement and layout than Google AdSense. This can be beneficial for publishers who want to customize their ad strategy or experiment with different ad formats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Requirements: Google AdSense has more stringent requirements for website traffic and content quality than Ezoic. This can make it more challenging for some publishers to qualify for Google AdSense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating your website with the Ezoic ad platform is a straightforward process. Here are the basic steps to integrate your site with Ezoic:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sign up: First, go to the Ezoic website and sign up for an account. You will need to provide some basic information about your website and create a new account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add your site: Once you have created your account, you will need to add your website to the Ezoic platform. To do this, click on the \u201cAdd Site\u201d button and enter your website\u2019s URL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Install the Ezoic script: By adding nameservers on domain name provider, cloudflare integration or use Ezoic\u2019s WordPress plugin to automate the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait for Ezoic to optimize your site: Once you have installed the Ezoic script, Ezoic will begin optimizing your website\u2019s layout and ad placement automatically using its\u00a0AI-based\u00a0optimization technology. This process can take several days, depending on your website\u2019s traffic and user engagement metrics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Configure your ad settings: After Ezoic has optimized your website\u2019s ad placement and layout, you can configure your ad settings using the Ezoic dashboard. You can choose which ad networks to use, set ad size and placement preferences, and configure other ad-related settings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ezoics_Affiliate_Program\"><\/span>Ezoic\u2019s Affiliate Program<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEgVfilbyz9ME0CEYo3YXlDBdnM1Yc2UFWFPJnCI1FTRYMt4Am22eS2NvCVMtf8FnNnAXLaCKsM931_VG76CwRYSn21bqbtuRWz46ZYDTOjvpMT2vZTDg2lmzRv680SKHF3Ds0ZQwWXMcUrTUblSep2Z12yDECMsU8gfBpdpE5p7A4eYaF8RZwFdNybv0Q\/s1330\/Ezoic&#039;s%20Affiliate%20program.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEgVfilbyz9ME0CEYo3YXlDBdnM1Yc2UFWFPJnCI1FTRYMt4Am22eS2NvCVMtf8FnNnAXLaCKsM931_VG76CwRYSn21bqbtuRWz46ZYDTOjvpMT2vZTDg2lmzRv680SKHF3Ds0ZQwWXMcUrTUblSep2Z12yDECMsU8gfBpdpE5p7A4eYaF8RZwFdNybv0Q\/s320\/Ezoic's%20Affiliate%20program.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ezoic has an affiliate program that allows publishers to earn commissions by referring new publishers to the Ezoic platform.

Once you\u2019ve signed up, you\u2019ll have access to your affiliate dashboard, where you can track your earnings and referrals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Share your referral link: Once you\u2019re signed up for the affiliate program, you\u2019ll be provided with a unique referral link that you can share with other publishers.
